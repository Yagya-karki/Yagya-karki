    <h2>CNN leads media coverage of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine</h2>
  <p>
    <br>February 25, 2022</br>
     
  As loud explosions from Russian artillery shells and missiles rattled the outskirts of Kharkiv, Ukraine, unnerved residents of the country’s second-largest city desperately sought shelter. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, scampered and crammed into the safest place they could find: underground in a railway station.
  
  And right there in the middle of it was CNN’s Clarissa Ward, interviewing an anxious mother with her 7-year-old son and 3-year-old daughter clinging to her sides.
  
  Meanwhile, approximately 300 miles away, at an airport just outside Kyiv, CNN’s Matthew Chance approached what he believed to be Ukrainian soldiers. As it turns out, they were Russian soldiers, prepared to fight for possession of the airport. With smoke billowing in the background and the sounds of gunfire, Chance and his team soon had to pack up their gear and scramble to safety. In another report, he was nearly caught in the middle of a firefight.
  
  And right there, in those moments aired just minutes apart, CNN showed why it remains television’s gold standard for fast-breaking international news.
  
  Controversy has surrounded CNN for the past couple of months. From the firing of Chris Cuomo to the resignation of president Jeff Zucker, the network has made more news behind the camera than in front of it.
  
  But don’t let that overshadow this fact: CNN once again turned into necessary viewing over the past 36 hours as Russia invaded Ukraine.
  
  To be clear, other networks are providing superb television coverage, but CNN’s powerful reach, experienced journalists and round-the-clock coverage are reasons why those looking for the absolute up-to-the-minute news immediately turn to CNN.
  
  What truly sets CNN apart is the boots-on-the-ground coverage from all over. Chance was in Kyiv. Ward and senior international correspondent Sam Kiley were in Kharkiv. CNN’s international security editor Nick Paton Walsh was in Kherson and senior national security correspondent Alex Marquardt was in Mariupol.
  
  In addition, anchors Erin Burnett, Michael Holmes and chief national security correspondent Jim Sciutto all anchored from Lviv, while other reporters were in Moscow and along the Poland-Ukraine border.
  
  That’s not all. CNN continually rolled in expert analysts, not only from within the U.S. government, but their own contributors such as Christiane Amanpour and military analyst Gen. Wesley Clark (Ret.), the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander. Such guests provide historical perspective, as well insightful analysis of how we got here, where we are and where we are going.
  
  Again, CNN is hardly alone in its excellent coverage, and I will get into the other outlets and their good work later in the newsletter. But CNN, despite often being accused of being partisan in its coverage, delivers comprehensive and factual programming when it comes to humongous stories like the one we’re witnessing right now.
  
  The New York Times’ Michael M. Grynbaum and Katie Robertson reported, “The head of CNN International, Mike McCarthy, said in an interview that the network had 75 people in Ukraine, including drivers and local interpreters. The network is using the city of Lviv in western Ukraine as its base, in part to ensure that broadcasts were not interrupted by cyberattacks that may affect Kyiv. He said CNN had ‘six or seven’ backup communications systems in case any failed.”
  
  The effort and resources result in coverage that is nearly impossible to turn away from.
